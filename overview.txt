Rough Overview of Project:
1. Input guide RNA (gRNA) csv, reference fasta and query fasta(s?)
2. Determine nature of query (reads, large genome, small genome)
3. Run BinDash and/or Mash to extract distances
4. Filter out distances above threshold value
	* How to choose threshold value?
5. Run off-target analysis for all selected gRNAs ONLY on sequences with distance scores below threshold
6. Plot results on interactive graph (plotly?)
